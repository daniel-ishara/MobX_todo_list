# mobx_todo_list

A todo list using mobx - demonstrative app.

## Getting Started

This project allows the user to create a list of tasks, adding new tasks and marking them as done.
It also has a login screen, but it's only a 'mock login' used to simulate and test MobX state management.
Furthermore, it's important to clearify that the task list is not saved, as this is not a practical application, but an app used to demonstrate the use of MobX.
